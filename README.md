# Water-Level-Controller-in-Wokwi
A water level controller created in Wokwi is an electronic simulation project that allows you to monitor and control the water level in a tank or container. The Wokwi simulation platform is used to create a virtual circuit that emulates the behavior of a real water level control system.
